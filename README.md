# Password Strength Analyzer

## Project Overview
This project is a cybersecurity tool that evaluates password strength based on security best practices. It analyzes passwords using multiple checks such as length, character variety, entropy calculation, and common password detection.

The tool helps users create stronger passwords and understand password security.

---

## Features 
- Password strength classification (Weak / Medium / Strong)
- Password entropy calculation
- Detection of common weak passwords
- Character validation:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- Security improvement suggestions
- Coloe-coded output

---

## Technologies Used 
- Python 3
- Regular Expressions (re module)
- Colorama (for colored ourput)
- Mathematical entropy calculation

---

## How It Works
The program evaluates password security using:

1. Password length check
2. Character diversity validation
3. Entropy calculation
4. Common password detection
5. Security scoring algorithm

The system provides strength level and recommendations.

---

## Installation 

Install dependencies:
pip3 install colorama

---

## Usage

Run the program:
python3 password_analyzer.py

Enter a password to analyze its strength.

---

## Security Concepts Implemented 
- Password entropy
- Input validation
- Security policy enforcement
- Weak credential detection

---

## Project Outcome
This project demonstrates understanding of authentication security and password protection mechanisms.
